                <h3>Easy Reach&reg; Toaster Oven with Roll-Top Door</h3>
                <img src="images/31126D-1.jpg" alt="Easy Reach Toaster Oven with Roll-Top Door" class="round">
				<p>MODEL: 31126D<br>$112.99</p>
                <p>You won’t find a design like the Davis Moore Easy Reach Toaster Oven with Roll-Top Door anywhere else. Its unique and large opening makes food easy to reach. And since the door opens above the oven, it frees up your countertop space in front. Best of all, it’s easy to keep clean because food can’t spill on the door. Contoured dials are easy to grip and turn, making it simple to switch between bake, broil and toast settings.The stay-on setting is safer thanks to a stop mechanism that prevents the knob from being turned to stay-on by accident.</p>
                <p>Unlike many other toaster ovens, this oven lets you choose between bake and convection. The bake function is great for making delicious cakes and desserts. Use convection for crisp, golden-brown pizza and for an evenly cooked, caramelized crust on baked goods. Convection provides more even cooking as the fan circulates heated air continuously around the food. Convection typically reduces cooking time by up to 25%.</p>
